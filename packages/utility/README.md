# JS utility Library Documentation

## Collection of libraries with classes and functions for JavaScript

### ðŸ’¡ To see the API of each use the Built-in Github "Symbols" explorer in each source file. All files are fully documented with JSDocs comments to describe the purpose and usage of each function included. (the link will take you to each source file)

<br/>
## Installation

The library is standalone (via browser script tag, loads the whole library) or modular, either the entire object or only a few functions since it is completely modular.

```javascript
npm i @knighttower/utility
```

## Description
Most functions here are extremely handy without the overhead of big libraries.  
However, for other most advance features it is recomended to also use other libraries, like if you need extensive use of Money, date, numbers functions (ex. money.js, moment.js, validate.js, lodash, v8n.js, jquery, moderndash, etc)


All functions are handy, but the most handy of all is **"emptyOrValue"** which helps to mitigate a lot of headaches when dealing with variables to know whether or not they have a value or even to set a default value when empty. From the powerHelper, there are a lot of regex and string functions that are very handy.
All Functions have also been Unit Tested and tests are in the source code if you want to experiment or see more examples.

<br/>

## Usage

```javascript
// note: in some cases, you may need to use the full path to the file "/index" in order to import it
// All other modules can also be imported individually from the same path
import utility from '@knighttower/utility';
//and or
import powerHelper from '@knighttower/utility';
// or
import { functionThatYouWantToUse, otherFunction } from '@knighttower/utility';
// or
import { utility as yourCustomName } from '@knighttower/utility';
import { functionThatYouWantToUse } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@knighttower/utility@latest/index.mjs';
```

Or even better, use it along with Vite and [Autoimport](https://github.com/unplugin/unplugin-auto-import) like:

```javascript
// In the vite config
import AutoImport from 'unplugin-auto-import/vite';

... plugins: [
        AutoImport({ imports: [ { '@knighttower/utility': ['utility'] }] }),
    ]

// and then in your code...

let something = utility.theFunctionYouWantToUse();
//ex: utility.emptyOrValue() // Autoimport will only import the 'emptyOrValue' module automatically
```
